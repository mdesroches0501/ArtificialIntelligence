# Compiling instructions:

If you are using Windows/Visual Studio you can simply download the project and open it in VS2017.

If you are using anything else a Makefile is included in each project.

Go to ProjectName/ProjectName/ and run make. This should properly compile the project.

Example:

	cd RomaniaSearch/RomaniaSearch
